## Overview

This project guides absolute beginners through best practices for AWS cloud security using IAM. Learn by launching EC2 instances, creating IAM users and groups, crafting precise IAM policies, and implementing the principle of least privilege. By the end, you will understand how to:
- Create and manage IAM users and groups.
- Set granular IAM policies for AWS resource access control.
- Use tags and policies to restrict access to sensitive environments.
- Configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Boost your AWS cloud portfolio!

## Project Goals

- Understand the purpose and power of AWS IAM.
- Practice setting up secure cloud infrastructure.
- Learn to restrict access and permissions using policies and user groups.
- Enable professional security protocols including account aliases and MFA.

## Features

- Launch and tag EC2 instances for production/development environments.
- Apply tagging strategies for automation and organization.
- Write and apply JSON IAM policies to restrict access.
- Create IAM users, groups, and attach policies.
- Bonus: Set an account alias for a clean login URL.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra security.
